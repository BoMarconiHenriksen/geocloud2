Install in a web root folder on an Apache web server, rename conf/main.default.php to conf/main.php and edit.

Run http://mysite.com//install/dbs.php

The script will check some (not yet all) dependencies and enable you to install MyGeoCloud in existing dbs. It will ONLY create a new schema called "settings". For an uninstall just drop the schema.
